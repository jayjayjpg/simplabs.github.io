          <h4>trainline</h4>
          <p>trainline is the leading booking site for European train tickets. They are selling tickets to customers worldwide, enabling more than 125,000 journeys every single day in and across 24 countries, covering 86 different carriers.</p>
          <p>trainline is also an early Ember.js adopter, having started to build their desktop website with Ember.js' predecessor SproutCore as early as 2010 and having stuck with the ecosystem ever since.</p>

          <h4>Challenge</h4>
          <p>While trainline had an existing desktop site and native mobile applications, with the growing web traffic from mobile devices and significant conversion drops imposed by forcing an app installation it became clear a mobile site was needed as well. </p>
          <p>After some internal restructuring, trainline needed additional engineering resources as well as external expertise to make sure the mobile site was built on time and on budget. At the same time providing high internal quality was critical both to ensure end user happiness as well as long term maintainability of the solution. </p>

          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>simplabs's team merged with trainline's internal<br>engineering team and built the initial release version<br>of the mobile site in just over 3 months. By working<br>closely with the in-house engineers we were not only<br>able to complete the release in time and on budget<br>but also to establish good development practices in<br>trainline's engineering team and to teach them<br>modern and idiomatic patterns for developing<br>Ember.js applications, all of which eventually lead to<br>significant improvements of the existing desktop<br>applications as well. </p>

          <p>In addition to supporting trainline with engineering resources and expertise we were also able to help improve the engineering process, establish and solidify a sprint based flow, resulting in improved planability and developer insight.</p>
          <p>Ember.js proved to be a great to choice for this kind of complex application. With its focus on conventions it allows for decent development pace while still ensuring long term stability and maintainability. Technologies like FastBoot and engines allow building large and complex applications for mobile devices without having to sacrifice performance and usability.</p>
          <p>As of June 2017, we are still an active part of the engineering team behind both the desktop and mobile sites, leading optimization efforts as well as driving development efforts for additional features. </p>
